Application for users that want to learn/improve typing skills. The idea for this
application is to assist in learning and keeping engagement high. Redundancy is a huge
issue in determining success or failure when learning something that seems boring. I hope to make an engaging app by keeping
the user is entertained while learning.

##User Stories 
* Users who want to learn how to type while making the experience fun.
* Users who have a hard time learning when the material is "dry".
* Users who want to have fun while working on a viable skill.

*As a user, I want to be able to type fast and learn how to type without the process being 
boring and non-engaging through solutions that are appealing. 

*As a parent of a user, I want the user, my child, to type correctly and keep them productive and  
entertained with replay-ability.

*As a teacher, teaching users how to type can easily become a bore and be a turn off because of the 
redundancy. I know I want users to have a certain proficiency at a certain age/grade 
level.

*It's never to late to learn how to type. I want to use popular contemporary music and 
it's influence to create a learning experience that is fun and productive.
